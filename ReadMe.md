## --- Julebord 2024 Attendance and Contributions Dashboard ---

This project provides an interactive dashboard to track RSVPs and contributions for Julebord 2024. 

Planning a Julebord can be a fun but time-consuming. 

Trying to gather RSVPs and coordinate contributions for snacks, cakes, and other items also takes time,
especially when working in several departments.
Keeping track of who will attend and what they want to bring often involves messy spreadsheets.

To simplify this process, I created this Julebord Dashboard:

Provides a clear overview of attendees who will join the event (Yes, No, Maybe).
Summarizes contributions, showing what items guests plans to bring. 
Makes it easier to coordinate and plan for a successful event with minimal hassle.

By visualizing the data in a user-friendly format with interactive charts and tables, 
this dashboard streamlines the organization process. 
This will give you more time to enjoy the holiday festivities!

## Features: 

Dynamic Data Integration: 
Fetches attendance and contribution details from a Google Sheet. I get real time updates.

Interactive Visualizations: 
Bar chart for attendance (Yes, No, Maybe). 
Displays detailed contribution breakdown with names and item details.

## Responsive Design: 
Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

*Technologies Used HTML5 & CSS3: For layout and styling. 
*JavaScript: To fetch and process data dynamically. 
*Chart.js: For creating beautiful and responsive charts. 
*Google Sheets: Used as the data source for RSVPs and contributions. 
*Netlify: To host the site.

## How It Works 
Fetches data from a public Google Sheets URL (in CSV format). 
Processes the data to: Count RSVPs for "Yes," "No," and "Maybe." 
Parse contribution details for items like snacks, cakes, and fruit platters. 
Dynamically updates tables and charts with processed data.

Future Enhancements Add more chart types for detailed insights. 
Allow filtering and searching within the tables. 
Integrate real-time data updates from Google Sheets. 

You can copy and paste this into your README.md file.
